# Master_Degree_uni-assignments

*These are my university assignments in Master's studies*

Directories:

+ Classical mathematical methods of complex systems using two other libraries by links, coded by good people:
  - https://github.com/QtExcel/QXlsx - for using Excel in Qt;
  - https://www.qcustomplot.com/index.php/download - for drawing graphs in Qt.
  * I really hope that, one day, decent libraries will be written for C++, comparable in power to Python :C
