# Master_Degree_uni-assignments

*These are my university assignments in Master's studies*

Directories:

+ Classical mathematical models of complex systems using two other libraries, coded by good people, by below links:

  Lab1:
  - https://github.com/QtExcel/QXlsx - for using Excel in Qt;
  - https://www.qcustomplot.com/index.php/download - for drawing graphs in Qt.
  * I really hope that, one day, decent libraries will be written for C++, comparable in power to Python :C
  
  Lab2-3:
  - UAVflight_ErrorAnalysis - second lab for synthetic data (UAV on-board system and integration system error);
  - UAV_flight_TOTAL - third lab for synthetic and experimental data (UAV on-board system and integration system error + flight trajectory graphs (latitude and longitude))
 
  Lab 4:
  - LifeGame - classical Conway's Game of Life (Cellular automaton);
  - LifeGameByEvents - Conway's Game of Life based on discrete events (Cellular automaton).
  * The Pygame library is used for visualisation and control the process. It's really cool that there are such powerful libraries and such cool ideas like cellular automata :)
  * This program also includes mechanisms for logging and saving visualization frames in .png format. Don't be surprised there are so many of them :)
 
  P.S. If you want to enjoy the simplest cellular automaton mechanism, use the first program, since the second one is more scientific in nature.
